# Identifying-Customer-Segments-Arvato-UNSUPERVISED-LEARNING-

## Project Overview

In this project, I work with real-life data provided to us by Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. I used PCA reduce the dimensionality and then performed KMeans Clustering to organize the general population & customers data into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, I also assess and clean the data in order to convert the data into a usable form.

## Data
